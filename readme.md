Hi there, this is a BASH script that you can run on a new installation of Ubuntu (or any Debian based Linux distro) that will help get you set up with all of your familiar key-bindings, packages and git repos and working directories that you desire.  

The default settings are tailored to what I personally use, but making changes is simple and easy and allows you to move easily from machine to machine (for all the distro hoppers).  If you're like me, you like your stuff to just work and would rather spare yourself the headache of reconfiguring by hand each time.
